I am a G1 PhD student at Caltech, advised by [Prof. Steven Low](https://netlab.caltech.edu/) in the Department of Computing + Mathematical Sciences. My research focuses on the modeling, simulation, and control of networked systems, particularly power systems. Currently, I am shifting my focus more towards control and optimization. Before, I conducted most of my research on developing specialized numerical algorithms to accelerate the simulation of power electronics-based power systems (see my selected [publications](/publication.html)).

Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree and master degree both in Electrical Engineering and a second bachelor degree in Mathematics at Tsinghua University. I was honored to be guided by [Prof. Zhengming Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aA1wPOQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and work with [Yangbin Zeng](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/ep/2024/0603/c18719a555482/page.htm) and [Jialin Zheng](https://charlinzheng.github.io/). We have done a lot of interesting things on building HIL simulation platforms!
